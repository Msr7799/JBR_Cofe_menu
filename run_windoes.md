[+96838 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
            The following assertion was thrown during layout:
            A RenderFlex overflowed by 25 pixels on the right.

            The relevant error-causing widget was:
              Row Row:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:1229:11

            To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
            http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

            The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
            The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
            black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
            Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
            RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
            This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
            seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
            ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
            like a ListView.
            The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#12a56 relayoutBoundary=up36 OVERFLOWING:
              creator: Row ← Column ← Padding ← DecoratedBox ← Padding ← Container ← Column ← Padding ← Padding ←
                DecoratedBox ← Container ← Opacity ← ⋯
              parentData: offset=Offset(0.0, 0.0); flex=null; fit=null (can use size)
              constraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=120.8, 0.0<=h<=Infinity)
              size: Size(120.8, 17.0)

[+8291 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 13 pixels on the right.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Row Row:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:1229:11

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.

[ +385 ms] flutter: ✅ First frame rendered, optimizing resources
[+8031 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 13 pixels on the right.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Row Row:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:1229:11

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#8beaf relayoutBoundary=up36 OVERFLOWING:
             creator: Row ← Column ← Padding ← DecoratedBox ← Padding ← Container ← Column ← Padding ← Padding ←
               DecoratedBox ← Container ← Opacity ← ⋯
             parentData: offset=Offset(0.0, 0.0); flex=null; fit=null (can use size)
             constraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=132.7, 0.0<=h<=Infinity)

[+8132 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 13 pixels on the right.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Row Row:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:1229:11

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#e871d relayoutBoundary=up36 OVERFLOWING:
             creator: Row ← Column ← Padding ← DecoratedBox ← Padding ← Container ← Column ← Padding ← Padding ←
               DecoratedBox ← Container ← Opacity ← ⋯
             parentData: offset=Offset(0.0, 0.0); flex=null; fit=null (can use size)
             constraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=132.7, 0.0<=h<=Infinity)

             Row Row:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:1229:11

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.

[+8284 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#3eb7a relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+6840 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.

[+7231 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#7085a relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+8234 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#ba1f9 relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+8044 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#58e6e relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+7697 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#bde78 relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+7451 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#d4a1d relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+7936 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#bcaae relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+7378 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#b148d relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+8052 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#27a40 relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

[+8078 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
           The following assertion was thrown during layout:
           A RenderFlex overflowed by 28 pixels on the bottom.

           The relevant error-causing widget was:
             Column
             Column:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2506:24

           To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
           http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
           like a ListView.
           The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#07e24 relayoutBoundary=up30 OVERFLOWING:

           If you are trying to perform a hit test during the layout phase itself, make sure you only hit test
           nodes that have completed layout (e.g. the node's children, after their layout() method has been
           called).

           The following assertion was thrown while handling a pointer data packet:

           Unfortunately, this object's geometry is not known at this time, probably because it has never been
           laid out. This means it cannot be accurately hit-tested.
           If you are trying to perform a hit test during the layout phase itself, make sure you only hit test
           nodes that have completed layout (e.g. the node's children, after their layout() method has been
           called).

[+21798 ms] ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
            The following assertion was thrown during layout:
            A RenderFlex overflowed by 13 pixels on the right.

            The relevant error-causing widget was:
              Row Row:file:///c:/Users/alrom/Desktop/MyApp/apk/JBR_Cofe_menu/lib/screens/home_screen.dart:1229:11

            To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:
            http://127.0.0.1:9103/#/inspector?uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A63477%2FweKHk12pKC4%3D%2F&inspectorRef=inspector-0

            The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
            The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
            black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
            Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
            RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
            This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
            seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
            ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
            like a ListView.

           The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
           The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
           black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
           Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
           RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
           This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
           seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
           ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
